mcmc
====

A Rust library implementing various MCMC diagnostics and utilities, such as Gelman Rubin
potential scale reduction factor ("RÌ‚" or "R hat"), effective sample size, chain splitting,
and others.

Implementation
--------------

Currently we expect plain vectors of `f64` floating point numbers.

Implementations for some of these diagnostics vary slightly, so reference implementations
are based on [Stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan), and unit tests are adapted to ensure
matching behavior.

Roadmap
-------

**Diagnostics**

- [X] Potential scale reduction factor
- [X] Split potential scale reduction factor
- [ ] Effective sample size
- [ ] Autocovariance

**Utilities**

- [X] Split chains as recommended in Vehtari, et al 2019
- [ ] Thinning

**Performance**

- [ ] Remove unnecessary copying or allocation
